<h2 id="about">About Us</h2>

Blackout Squad is a non-profit sports club dedicated to encouraging people of African origin to participate in <abbr title="Obstacle Course Races">OCRs</abbr> and other outdoor fitness events. We first came together in 2016 as a group of OCR newbies scared witless by the unknown challenges of [Tough Mudder](https://toughmudder.co.uk), but having successfully conquered that, we've continued to tackle other events like [Rough Runner](https://roughrunner.com), [Spartan Race](https://www.spartanrace.uk/en), [Nuclear Races](https://nuclear-races.co.uk) and more.

### Our Manifesto

#### We believe

- that improved health is possible no matter what your level of fitness is today
- that we can achieve more together than we can on our own
- the gym is not the only way to get in shape

#### We value

- effort, not excuses
- respect, not rudeness
- camaraderie, not cliquishness
- banter, not bullying
- support, not selfishness
- encouragement, not enforcement
- Challenge, not comfort

#### We're committed to

- supporting people of African origin to improve their personal health and well-being through group training and individual challenges;
- increasing the participation and visibility of members of our communities across outdoor fitness events and competitions;
- challenging negative stereotypes applied against age, gender and culture;
- supporting charitable causes that benefit our communities;
- providing a safe, welcoming environment for members to develop positive social relationships.
